## Building the App with ADT

### Google Play Services

1. Install Google Play Services in Extras through the Android SDK Manager
2. File > Import > Android/Existing Android Code into Workspace and choose <android-sdk>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib/
3. Check "Is Library" in Properties > Android

See http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html

### Android Maps Utils

1. Make sure to also pull submodules (`git submodule init && git submodule update --recursive`)
2. File > Import > Android/Existing Android Code into Workspace and choose android-maps-utils/library
3. Check "Is Library" in Properties > Android
4. Add Google Play Services as dependency in Properties > Android
5. Add Stolpersteine/libs/android-support-v4.jar as dependency in Java Build Path > Libraries

See http://googlemaps.github.io/android-maps-utils/#start

### Run App

1. File > Import... > Android/Existing Android Code Into Workspace
2. Choose Stolpersteine folder and import
3. Add dependency to Google Play Services and Android Maps Utils in Properties > Android > Library
4. Fix the source-folders in Properties > Java Build Path > Source. You have to remove the /src-folder and add /src/main/java and /src/androidTest/java because Eclipse can't recognize standard layouts.
5. Use your own API key in AndroidManifest.xml or have the SHA1 of your keystore registered with an existing API key

    keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
    
6. Configure a virtual device with Android 4.x with Google Play Services ([Guide to install Google Play Services on Genymotion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17831990/how-do-you-install-google-frameworks-play-accounts-etc-on-a-genymotion-virtu). Alternatively, use a hardware device
7. Run as Android Application

### Run Tests

1. File > Import... > Android/Existing Android Code Into Workspace
2. Choose StolpersteineTest folder and import
3. Add dependency to Stolpersteine in Properties > Java Build Path > Projects
3. Configure to run as Android JUnit Test

Note: set the text encoding in ADT to UTF-8 (Preferences > General > Workspace). Otherwise, test cases that use German characters will fail.

### Requires Android Version

API Level 15+, Android 4.0.x (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher
